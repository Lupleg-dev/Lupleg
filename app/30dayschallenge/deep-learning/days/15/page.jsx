        Machine learning models are becoming increasingly complex and
        sophisticated, making them more challenging to interpret and understand.
        Here are some strategies to improve the performance and robustness of
        your machine learning models.

          <strong>1. Data Augmentation:</strong> Data augmentation is a technique
          used to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by applying
          various transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, flipping,
          and scaling. This can help improve the generalization and robustness of
          your model by exposing it to a wider range of variations in the input
          data.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          <strong>2. Regularization:</strong> Regularization is a technique used to
          prevent overfitting in machine learning models by adding a penalty term
          to the loss function that discourages the model from learning complex
          patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to unseen
          data. Common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization,
          dropout, and early stopping.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          <strong>3. Hyperparameter Tuning:</strong> Hyperparameter tuning involves
          optimizing the hyperparameters of a machine learning model to improve its
          performance. This can be done manually by adjusting the hyperparameters
          based on trial and error, or automatically using techniques such as grid
          search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.
