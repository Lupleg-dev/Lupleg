          Every biological process in the body, from cell growth to immune
          responses, depends on interactions between molecules called proteins.
          Like a key to a lock, one protein can bind to another, helping
          regulate critical cellular processes. Protein structure prediction
          tools like AlphaFold have already given us tremendous insight into how
          proteins interact with each other to perform their functions, but
          these tools cannot create new proteins to directly manipulate those
          interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scientists, however, can create novel proteins that successfully bind
          to target molecules. These binders can help researchers accelerate
          progress across a broad spectrum of research, including drug
          development, cell and tissue imaging, disease understanding and
          diagnosis â€“ even crop resistance to pests. While recent machine
          learning approaches to protein design have made great strides, the
          process is still laborious and requires extensive experimental
          testing.

        <p>
          Today, we introduce AlphaProteo, our first AI system for designing
          novel, high-strength protein binders to serve as building blocks for
          biological and health research. This technology has the potential to
          accelerate our understanding of biological processes, and aid the
          discovery of new drugs, the development of biosensors and more.
