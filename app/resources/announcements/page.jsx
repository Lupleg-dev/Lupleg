        Today we are thrilled to announce that WorkOS has acquired Warrant, the
        Fine Grained Authorization (FGA) service.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
        FGA allows developers to implement precise access controls within their
        applications, ensuring robust security and data compliance. In other
        words, it determines who has access to what and what they can do within
        an app. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization
        system called Zanzibar, which was originally developed by Google to
        power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at
        enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to
        any application.
